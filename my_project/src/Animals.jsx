    <h3>Komodo dragons</h3>
    <p> Komodo dragons can have so-called virgin births. As well as mating with males the species is parthenogenetic: in other words, the females can lay fertile eggs without any input from males. This will only reproduce identical young, however. For the species to continue to adapt, it needs to mate.</p>

    <h3>Chicken</h3>
    <p>A chicken once lived for 18 months without a head. When a chickenâ€™s head is chopped off, the severed nerves send impulses to the muscles of the legs and wings, which can cause the remainder of the bird to run around in a flap.</p>
